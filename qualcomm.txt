#1.Code snippet to dynamically alloacte 1D and 2D arrays

{{{{{{{{okay so one thing 
malloc function assings garbage values to the memory location and returns a void type pointer 
which can be typecasted.
ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)

“calloc” or “contiguous allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate the specified
number of blocks of memory of the specified type. It initializes each block with a default value ‘0’.
ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);

“realloc” or “re-allocation” method in C is used to dynamically change the memory allocation of 
a previously allocated memory. In other words, if the memory previously allocated with the help of 
malloc or calloc is insufficient, realloc can be used to dynamically re-allocate memory.
 re-allocation of memory maintains the already present value and new blocks will be initialized 
 with default garbage value.

Syntax:

ptr = realloc(ptr, newSize);
where ptr is reallocated with new size 'newSize'.}}}}}}}}}}

so,=====>
1_d
int * arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

for 2D=======>
//rows allocated
int **arr = malloc(n*sizeof(int*);

for(int i =0;i<n;i++)
 arr[i]=(int*)malloc(n*sizeof(int));

same above thing with a cpp Code
1_d
    //                 cout<< "little endian";}
    // dynamically allocate memory of size `N`
    int* A = new int[N];
2_d
    // dynamically allocate memory of size `M × N`
    int* A = new int[M * N];

--->The translator which performs macro calls expansion is called Macro 
pre - processor.

--->A Macro processor is a program that copies a stream of text from one place
 to another, making a systematic set of replacements as it does so.

--->A Dynamic linker is the part of an operating system that loads and links 
the shared libraries.

--->The C preprocessor is a micro processor that is used by compiler to 
transform your code before compilation. It is called micro pre-processor 
because it allows us to add macros.
